* How to build the system?
  Its so simple. just run

  $./install.sh

  The script will do everything for you. Then you need to use qemu to
  launch the OS

  $qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom vuos.iso

  If you want to compile it manually you have to first run

  $./configure

  Then, if you just want to compile the code, run make.

  $make

  if you want to compile the operating system and run it, you have to
  run

  $make install

  This will compile the operating system, and create an ISO image that you
  can use to run the OS.
