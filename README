* How to build the system?

  $./configure

  Then, if you just want to compile the code, run make.

  $make

  if you want to compile and create an ISO image to run, use

  $make install

  This will compile the operating system, and create an ISO image that you
  can use to run the OS. You can use Bochs emulator to run this ISO image.
